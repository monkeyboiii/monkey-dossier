## 1 The Why ‚ùì

I was tasked to use `clickhouse-cpp`, a third party [library](https://github.com/ClickHouse/clickhouse-cpp) to interface with [ClickHouse](http://clickhouse.com/) database from my C++ codebase (my project for convenience), and I was excited to implement it. Little did I know, this was the beginning of a month-long <span style={{color:'#ff8000'}}>struggle</span> to get it working. At least in the journey, I refreshed my knowledge of C++, compiling/linking, [template metapprogramming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template_(C%2B%2B)), and multi-threading.

## 2 The Start üìç

The first step was to build the library from source, which was seemingly straightforward. In itself, the library was a CMake project, and I was able to build it. But when I try to use it in the context of my project, all sorts of problems started appearing out of nowhere. So grab your ‚õëÔ∏è, relax, and see how I stubbed my toes, repeatedly!

### 2.1 Symbol Conflict Resolution {#symbol-conflict-resolution}

My project uses custom build scripts, and has a rigorous process for third party inclusions, i.e. scanning, integration with CI, etc. So when I tried to directly use the build artifact from the original `CMakeLists.txt`, the first hurdle there was symbol conflicts with my Macros flying around, specifically `Int64`, `Int32`, `UInt64`, `UInt32`. These were problematic since it was <span style={{color:'#e74c3c'}}>unrealistic</span> to change my codebase, so I had to do refactoring in the *clickhouse-cpp* source code. What I ended up doing was changed all occurrences of these symbols. For example, `Int64` alone had 40 places to change!

### 2.2 Third Party for clickhouse-cpp

The *clickhouse-cpp* library itself has stripped down versions of third party libraries under the [contrib](https://github.com/ClickHouse/clickhouse-cpp/tree/master/contrib) directory, such as

1. *abseil*
2. *cityhash*
3. *lz4*
4. *zstd*

So when my project tried to compile, the header files from these libraries were missing, because the default build artifact didn't emit those. So for each of the `CMakeLists.txt` under each third party library, I appended this instruction to install them.

```CMake
INSTALL (DIRECTORY ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}
    DESTINATION include
    FILES_MATCHING 
        PATTERN "*.h"
        PATTERN "*.inc"
)
```

#### 2.2.1 OpenSSL
One particularly messy third party library is *OpenSSL*. Because my project builds *OpenSSL* in-house, I actually wanted the *clickhouse-cpp* to link against our own *OpenSSL* binaries rather than its bundled version. In my custom build scripts, I added several build options.

```shell
cmake ${SRC} \
	-DOPENSSL_INCLUDE_DIR=${OPENSSL_INCLUDE_DIR} \
	-DOPENSSL_CRYPTO_LIBRARY=libcrypto.so \
	-DOPENSSL_SSL_LIBRARY=libssl.so \
	-DWITH_OPENSSL=ON \
	-DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON
```

:::tip[outcome]
After this, the build artifact is a shared library with its third party libraries statically linked into them, and all the header  files installed to desired directory.
:::

### 2.3 Multi-platform Build and CI

Successfully built for local development, I have to automate all those step by writing a script for CI to use. As for Windows, I let professionals do their professional jobs in this case üòä, shout out to my CI <span style={{color:'#33c1ff'}}>teammates</span>.

#### 2.3.1 Linux

Linux uses `.so` files for shared library and dynamic linking, and symbols are exported by default.

#### 2.3.2 Windows

Windows uses `.dll` files for shared libraries and `.lib` files as import libraries, and symbols are <span style={{color:'#e74c3c'}}>not</span> exported [by default](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/cpp/dllexport-dllimport?view=msvc-170). And for debug build, `.pdb` files are also emitted for Visual Studio debugger to map compiled code back to the original source code. So what the CI team ended up doing was to let `cmake` emit those extra third parties as [static libraries](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/reference/overview-of-lib?view=msvc-170) also in `.lib`s, and then from my project, I

1. statically link against these extra third parties directly,
2. dynamically link against the *clickhouse-cpp* library.

## 3 The Coding üë®‚Äçüíª

After all those <span style={{color:'#ff8000'}}>hassles</span>, I was finally writing code. In short, there were two versions of the implementation in the process, and we are finally getting to the template part.

### 3.1 First Implementation

In the first try, I wrote code for a very specific use case, targeting only one downstream sub-project within my project (fairly low in the dependency tree). I did some simple ad-hoc optimizations such as

* overlapping data preparation with data transmission, using `std::future`
* tabular data duplicate column buffering
* block size estimation and pre-allocation

The results were generally acceptable, and my code got merged into the main branch ‚úåÔ∏è.

### 3.2 Second Implementation

:::warning[pain starts]
:::

But that was when things took a <span style={{color:'#e74c3c'}}>sharp</span> turn. I had another request that a new feature would also use the *ClickHouse* functionality, which called for a rewrite.

Since that feature belonged to another sub-project, I wanted to abstract away the complexity of linking with *clickhouse-cpp*, by **moving the implementation to a top-level sub-project**, so that downstream code could use it without needing to link the dependency themselves, to <span style={{color:'#33c1ff'}}>minimize</span> build time and avoid linking (on that damn Windows).

This seemed like a great design, let's do it!

<img className="mdx-img" src={OrIsItImageUrl} alt="or-is-it"/>

#### 3.2.1 Type Mapping

The first hurdle was type mapping. Since the first implementation had a very consistent data type mapping relations, and only in one dimension, mapping can be done quite easily. But the new feature required an array of `float32`s, which was a nightmare to my previous design.

To address that, I have two separate classes to manage mapped column types

1. `OneDimDataType`, original, mapped by one dimensional data types
2. `PlainDataType`, mapped by plain names

These two classes come in handy when I want to know which column type a *ClickHouse* column is, so that I could do proper data manipulation.

#### 3.2.2 Reading üåü

Since my first implementation didn't involve reading values, I didn't do anything for that matter. Now, there was a need to read data into C++. That was when my puny brain started doing the <span style={{color:'#e74c3c'}}>**unimaginables**</span> - templates! I first thought by implementing a read template method and use concrete types like

```cpp
template<typename T>
class ClickHouseColumn
{
	// ColumnRef is from the clickhouse-cpp API
	void ReadIntoVector(const ColumnRef&, std::vector<T>&);
};

template<typename T>
void ClickHouseColumn<T>::ReadIntoVector(const ColumnRef& col, std::vector<T>& value)
{
	// impl ...
}
```

would suffice, and

> wow templates are so cool, lol üòÇ

so I immediately started refactoring my class interface.

And this top-level sub-project compiled just fine. But when I tried to link against this top-level sub-project in downstream sub-projects that needed this read function, I got <span style={{color:'#e74c3c'}}>errors</span> that I had unresolved symbols. That weekend, I was scratching my head going through StackOverflow, ChatGPT, Reddit and more to furiously figure out what was wrong, only to later realize the

:::danger[culprit]
is template instantiation at compile time!
:::

It happened because

1. When my top-level sub-project compiled, the implementation had been moved to `.h` header files, for templates to work.
2. When my downstream sub-project needed to use the interface, it tried to specialize it.
3. The downstream sub-project saw the implementation of calling to *ClickHouse* specific functions.
	- most <span style={{color:'#ff8000'}}>notably</span> the destructor
	- any other calls to the *clickhouse-cpp* library
4. The downstream sub-project now had to link against *clickhouse-cpp*, which went contrary to where we started.

As a result, even though the downstream code didn't directly include the *clickhouse-cpp* library, the template class would force the compiler to instantiate the full implementation every time a translation unit included the template.

##### 3.2.2.1 The Fix ‚úÖ

To decouple the interface from the third party dependency, I replaced templates with abstract base classes and virtual destructors. Each concrete implementation now lives in the top-level sub-project, hiding *ClickHouse* details from downstream consumers. And I sprinkled some 

1. `dynamic_pointer_cast`
2. or `static_pointer_cast` if I was feeling lucky

to get the correct type at runtime, in each downstream sub-project that needed to use the interface.

:::tip[Lesson]
Templates can inadvertently propagate third-party dependencies through header files. Use runtime polymorphism when isolation matters.
:::

#### 3.2.3 Multi-threading

To speed up reading/writing, I use multiple threads to simultaneously operate on the same database. This lead to [thread safety](https://github.com/ClickHouse/clickhouse-cpp?tab=readme-ov-file#thread-safety) issues, which I was not aware of, half due to my carelessness. I instantiated one `Client` for each thread.

## 4 Misc üêõ

Now what if I want to track *clickhouse-cpp* updates? I follow below workflow to <span style={{color:'#33c1ff'}}>minimize</span> the manual work I have do each time I want to upgrade the third party version.

Specifically, I use `git subtree` to manage updates. Suppose the source code lives under `source` directory, I prepared the repo like so.

```shell
# commit 1
rm -rf source/*

# commit 2
git subtree pull --prefix=source git@github.com:ClickHouse/clickhouse-cpp.git master --squash

# commit 3
# the renaming commit

# commit 4
rm -rf source/.*

# commit 5
git cherry-pick <commit hash for the renaming>
```

The rationale behind the renaming commit 3 is introduced at part [2.1](#symbol-conflict-resolution).

These steps ensure a traceable commit history. Using subtree I can manage upgrades while preserving the commits I made to the directory, so future upgrades are as simple as

```shell
git subtree pull \
	--prefix=source \
	git@github.com:ClickHouse/clickhouse-cpp.git [target branch] \
	--squash
```

plus some manual work if newly introduced code has used conflicting symbols.
